    </p>

    <h2>Broccoli Soup Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
      <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>8 cups broccoli florets</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cook the Vegetables </strong></li>
      <p>
        Sauté the onions and celery in butter until they're tender. Add the
        broccoli florets and the chicken broth, cover the pot, and simmer for
        about 10 minutes.
      </p>

      <li><strong>Cook the Ingredients</strong></li>
      <p>
        You can use a countertop blender or an immersion blender to purée the
        soup. Give it a few quick pulses, then blend continuously until the soup
        is totally smooth.
      </p>

      <li><strong>Thicken the Soup </strong></li>
      <p>
        Melt a few tablespoons of butter in a separate saucepan. Stir in the
        flour, then the milk. Cook the milk mixture until it's thick and bubbly,
        then add it to the soup. Finish it off with a dash of pepper (and the
        other seasonings of your choosing).
